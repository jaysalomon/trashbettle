## Research Components

### 1. Theoretical Framework
The foundational document (`A Framework for Autonomous.md`) presents:
- Multi-functional flow lattice architecture
- Thermodynamic optimization for heat delivery vs. retention
- Bio-hybrid system integration
- Energy balance analysis projecting net-positive operation
- Manufacturing considerations using LPBF additive manufacturing

### 2. Simulation & Experimental Validation
The experiments document (`experiments.md`) provides:
- GPU-accelerated heat transfer simulations using PyTorch/CUDA
- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) protocols for micro-chamber validation
- Home-lab prototype designs for empirical testing
- Pressure drop calculations for lattice flow optimization

## Key Innovations

1. **Thermal Coupling Efficiency**: Projected >95% efficiency through distributed micro-combustion
2. **System Integration**: Unified architecture serving structural, thermal, and control functions
3. **Scale Optimization**: Mathematical proof that efficiency scales as η ∝ 1/diameter
4. **Energy Independence**: Multi-modal generation (solar, biological, chemical) achieving ~0.3 kWh daily surplus

## Simulation Environment

### Hardware Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 (16GB VRAM) or equivalent CUDA-capable GPU
- **RAM**: 32GB minimum
- **Storage**: 50GB for simulation data and results

### Software Stack
```bash
# Core dependencies
- CUDA Toolkit 10.2+
- PyTorch with GPU support
- OpenFOAM 10+ (optional: GPU-accelerated fork)
- ParaView for visualization
- Python 3.8+
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install CUDA toolkit
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-cuda-toolkit

# Install PyTorch with GPU
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102

# Run heat transfer simulation
python simulations/heat_solver.py

# Run pressure drop analysis
python simulations/pressure_drop.py
```

## Experimental Prototypes

### Buildable Components (Budget: <$200)

| Component | Purpose | Key Measurement |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Micro-chamber heat source** | Validate thermal delivery scaling | Temperature gradient, heat flux |
| **Pressure drop test rig** | Verify Hagen-Poiseuille predictions | ΔP vs. flow rate |
| **3D-printed flow lattice** | Test honeycomb channel architecture | Flow distribution, mixing |
| **Solar carapace mockup** | Validate supplementary power generation | Power output under varied conditions |
| **Nitinol actuator** | Test thermal-mechanical coupling | Actuation force vs. temperature |
| **Mini bio-reactor** | Assess biological processing viability | Growth rate vs. thermal input |

## Paper Generation

### LaTeX Document Structure
The final paper will integrate:
1. **Theoretical foundations** from the framework document
2. **Simulation results** from GPU-accelerated models
3. **Experimental validation** from prototype testing
4. **Performance metrics** comparing theoretical vs. empirical data

### Building the Paper
```bash
# Navigate to paper directory
cd paper/

# Compile LaTeX document
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex

# Or use latexmk for automated compilation
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

## Key Results (Expected)

### Thermal Performance
- 3× improvement in heat delivery efficiency for 4mm vs. 12mm chambers
- >100× increase in surface area with 1000-chamber network
- 95% thermal coupling vs. 60% for conventional exchangers

### Energy Balance
- **Generation**: ~1.0 kWh/day (solar + bio + chemical)
- **Consumption**: ~0.7 kWh/day (processing + locomotion + control)
- **Net Surplus**: ~0.3 kWh/day enabling autonomous operation

### System Integration
- 40-60% mass reduction through multi-functional components
- Elimination of discrete thermal, structural, and control subsystems
- Inherent redundancy through distributed architecture

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Important Safety Notes**:
- Use low-voltage DC supplies (≤12V) for heating elements
- Ensure proper ventilation when testing combustion/reactions
- Wear heat-resistant gloves and eye protection
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible
- Never leave experiments unattended
