\section{Simulation Code Listings}
\label{app:code}

% This appendix can contain key code snippets if needed
% For now, we'll leave it as a placeholder

The complete simulation code is available in the project repository at:
\texttt{simulations/scripts/}

Key simulation scripts include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{heat\_solver\_gpu.py} - GPU-accelerated heat transfer simulation
    \item \texttt{pressure\_drop\_analysis.py} - Hydraulic network analysis
    \item \texttt{lattice\_generator.py} - Parametric lattice geometry generation
    \item \texttt{installation\_check.py} - Environment validation
\end{itemize}
