\subsection{Implications for Artificial Life}

The present results provide an initial quantitative foundation for a multi-functional flow lattice architecture supporting partial on-board energy autonomy. Rather than a paradigm shift already realized, the findings indicate a pathway toward extended operational persistence by integrating distributed micro-combustion, passive thermal coupling, and organism-mediated waste conversion.

\subsection{Manufacturing Considerations}

The transition from prototype to production requires addressing:

\subsubsection{Material Selection}
While prototypes used PLA and PETG, production units require:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 316L stainless steel for high-temperature chambers
    \item Inconel 718 for extreme thermal cycling regions
    \item Bio-compatible coatings for organism integration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additive Manufacturing Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal channel surface roughness: Target Ra < 1.6 $\mu$m
    \item Powder removal from 2mm channels: Ultrasonic cleaning required
    \item Thermal stress management: Optimized support structures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ecological and Ethical Considerations}

\subsubsection{Environmental Impact}
The deployment of waste-consuming organisms offers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decentralized waste processing reducing transportation
    \item Conversion of plastic waste to useful energy
    \item Reduction in landfill accumulation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ethical Framework}
Creating autonomous organisms raises questions about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rights and responsibilities toward self-sustaining artificial life
    \item Ecological niche competition with biological organisms
    \item Control mechanisms for population management
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Key limitations of the current computational study:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thermal model idealizations:} Explicit diffusion with simplified boundary convection; non-monotonic diameter efficiency indicates geometric sensitivity unresolved by a single discretization.
    \item \textbf{Energy balance correlations:} Independence assumption optimistic; adverse correlation stress test increases daily deficit probability from 0.6\% to 15\%.
    \item \textbf{Hydraulic regime mismatch:} Several high-flow cases exceed laminar bounds (Re$>2300$), limiting applicability of Hagen-Poiseuille scaling without correction.
    \item \textbf{PCM buffering simplicity:} Lumped enthalpy approach underestimates spatial gradients; variance reduction remains \(<11\%$)$ below stretch goals.
    \item \textbf{Biological integration:} Waste conversion kinetics and long-term bio-reactor stability not yet simulated.
\end{itemize}

Future research directions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coupled thermo-fluid CFD with turbulence transition modeling for lattice manifolds.
    \item Multi-state stochastic energy model including seasonal and diurnal correlation matrices.
    \item Advanced PCM geometry and cascaded phase transition design for >25\% variance attenuation.
    \item Experimental validation of micro-chamber heat recirculation at scale with additive metal prototypes \cite{frazier2014metal,ngo2018additive,yap2015review}.
    \item Adaptive control and distributed scheduling leveraging evolutionary multi-objective optimization \cite{coello2007evolutionary,banzhaf1998genetic} to balance energy, resilience, and actuation latency.
\end{itemize}
